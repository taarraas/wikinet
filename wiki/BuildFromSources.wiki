#summary Building from sources

= Requirements =
# jdk 1.6 (or later)
# maven
# ant
# activemq (optional)

= Steps =

# Checkout sources
svn checkout http://wikinet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ wikinet
# Change working directory to wikinet
cd wikinet
# Clean up build directories if any
mvn clean
# Build project
mvn package
NOTE: if you don't have activemq running or you just don't want to run tests then use 
"mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true" instead
# Assemble modules and create wikinet zip-archive
ant

Now you should get wikinet.zip in wikinet/target directory.
