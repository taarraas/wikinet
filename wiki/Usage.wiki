#summary Project usage information

=== Pre-Requirements ===
This guide assumes you have downloaded and unpacked wikinet bundle (or built it from scratch). Also you need several environment configurations to be made before you can actually use it:
1. You must have Ubuntu or any other Linux OS. (As a matter of fact it's not strict requirement and wikinet should work fine under Windows or Mac OS. But it hasn't been tested using such environments and thus only .sh files are provided)
2. You should download Apache ActiveMQ from [http://activemq.apache.org], unpack it and run ${ACTIVEMQ_HOME_DIR}/bin/activemq, assuming ${ACTIVEMQ_HOME_DIR} points to ActiveMQ home directory. This step is necessary only for wikinet extender and mapper modules work.
